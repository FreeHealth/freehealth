We recommand that you install FreeHealth EHR databases on 1 of the following RDBMS:

The alternative installation procedure using SQLite database is deprecated.
SQlite support will be discontinued in the next release and one of the RDBMS
will become mandatory.

If you are upgrading from FreeMedFoms 0.9.8, install FreeHealth 0.9.9 first: the
upgrade process is automatic, you just need to answer Yes to 2 questions about
copying FreeMedForms parameters folder and user folder. If you want to switch
from FreeMedForms 1.0.0, contact us, we are working on a conversion tool.
