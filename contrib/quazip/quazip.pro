    # ZLib notes:
    # We need to compile a comptabile zlib version in some particular cases.
    # The internal zlib is built as a static lib.

    # On Mac OS X the zlib version is too old (1.2.3 on 10.6.8), and we need the newest one.
    # So without distinction of OS version we compile the included zlib to use it as internal.

    # On Windows* there are no available precompiled zlib.

    # For all Linux version, user will install FreeHealth' apps using his prefered
    # package manager, and all apps will depend on a compatible zlib version.
