Adding FMF Qt Creator Wizards
=============================

This directory contains wizards for QtCreator

You can create a link in the QtCreator templates directory to one or more of
these directories here, so they can be used as templates within QtCreator.

Put the link in one of the following directories:

 * /home/$USER/.config/QtProject/qtcreator/templates/wizards
(the local user's configuration folder, RECOMMENDED!)
 * share/qtcreator/templates/wizards

Installation procedure:
