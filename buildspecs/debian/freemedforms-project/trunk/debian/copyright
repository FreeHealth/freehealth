   THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS
   CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS
   PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK
   OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS
   PROHIBITED.
 .
   BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND
   AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU
   THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
 .
   1. Definitions
    a. "Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue,
       anthology or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in
       unmodified form, along with a number of other contributions,
       constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are
       assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a
       Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as
       defined below) for the purposes of this License.
    b. "Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work
       and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical
       arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture
       version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment,
       condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast,
       transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a
       Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the
       purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work
       is a musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of
       the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be
       considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.
    c. "Licensor" means the individual or entity that offers the Work
       under the terms of this License.
    d. "Original Author" means the individual or entity who created the
       Work.
    e. "Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the
       terms of this License.
    f. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this
       License who has not previously violated the terms of this License
       with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission
       from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a
       previous violation.
    g. "License Elements" means the following high-level license
       attributes as selected by Licensor and indicated in the title of
       this License: Attribution, ShareAlike.
 .
   2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce,
   limit, or restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or
   other limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under
   copyright law or other applicable laws.
 .
   3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
   Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
   perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
   exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
    a. to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
       Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
       Collective Works;
    b. to create and reproduce Derivative Works;
    c. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform
       publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio
       transmission the Work including as incorporated in Collective
       Works;
    d. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform
       publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio
       transmission Derivative Works.
    e. For the avoidance of doubt, where the work is a musical
       composition:
         i. Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor waives
            the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a
            performance rights society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties
            for the public performance or public digital performance (e.g.
            webcast) of the Work.
        ii. Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives the
            exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a
            music rights society or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox
            Agency), royalties for any phonorecord You create from the
            Work ("cover version") and distribute, subject to the
            compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US
            Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).
    f. Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of
       doubt, where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the
       exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a
       performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for the
       public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work, subject to
       the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114 of the US
       Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).
 .
   The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
   known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make
   such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights
   in other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by
   Licensor are hereby reserved.
 .
   4. Restrictions.The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly
   made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
    a. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
       digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License,
       and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier
       for, this License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You
       distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
       digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the
       Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the
       recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not
       sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to
       this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not
       distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
       digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that
       control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the
       terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to the Work as
       incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the
       Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject to
       the terms of this License. If You create a Collective Work, upon
       notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable,
       remove from the Collective Work any reference to such Licensor or
       the Original Author, as requested. If You create a Derivative Work,
       upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable,
       remove from the Derivative Work any reference to such Licensor or
       the Original Author, as requested.
    b. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
       digitally perform a Derivative Work only under the terms of this
       License, a later version of this License with the same License
       Elements as this License, or a Creative Commons iCommons license
       that contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g.
       Attribution-ShareAlike 2.0 Japan). You must include a copy of, or
       the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License or other license
       specified in the previous sentence with every copy or phonorecord
       of each Derivative Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly
       perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose
       any terms on the Derivative Works that alter or restrict the terms
       of this License or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted
       hereunder, and You must keep intact all notices that refer to this
       License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not
       distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
       digitally perform the Derivative Work with any technological
       measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner
       inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The above
       applies to the Derivative Work as incorporated in a Collective
       Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the
       Derivative Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this
       License.
    c. If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
       digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective
       Works, You must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and
       give the Original Author credit reasonable to the medium or means
       You are utilizing by conveying the name (or pseudonym if
       applicable) of the Original Author if supplied; the title of the
       Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform
       Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be
       associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the
       copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and in the
       case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use of the Work
       in the Derivative Work (e.g., "French translation of the Work by
       Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original
       Author"). Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner;
       provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or
       Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any
       other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least
       as prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.
 .
   5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
 .
   UNLESS OTHERWISE AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS
   THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND
   CONCERNING THE MATERIALS, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE,
   INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,
   FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF
   LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF
   ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW
   THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO
   YOU.
 .
   6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE
   LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR
   ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES
   ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR
   HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
   7. Termination
    a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
       automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
       Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works or
       Collective Works from You under this License, however, will not
       have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or
       entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1,
       2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
    b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here
       is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the
       Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to
       release the Work under different license terms or to stop
       distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such
       election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other
       license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the
       terms of this License), and this License will continue in full
       force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
 .
   8. Miscellaneous
    a. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or
       a Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license
       to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted
       to You under this License.
    b. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative
       Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original
       Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You
       under this License.
    c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
       applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability
       of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further
       action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be
       reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision
       valid and enforceable.
    d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
       breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in
       writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or
       consent.
    e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties
       with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no
       understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the
       Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any
       additional provisions that may appear in any communication from
       You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written
       agreement of the Licensor and You.
 .
   Creative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty
   whatsoever in connection with the Work. Creative Commons will not be
   liable to You or any party on any legal theory for any damages
   whatsoever, including without limitation any general, special,
   incidental or consequential damages arising in connection to this
   license. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative
   Commons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor hereunder, it
   shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.
 .
   Except for the limited purpose of indicating to the public that the
   Work is licensed under the CCPL, neither party will use the trademark
   "Creative Commons" or any related trademark or logo of Creative Commons
   without the prior written consent of Creative Commons. Any permitted
   use will be in compliance with Creative Commons' then-current trademark
