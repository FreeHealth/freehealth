### ![FreeMedForms logo](img/logoddi.png) The FreeMedForms project

* a suite of medical applications
  * Electronic Medical Record
  * prescription assistant (Computerized Physician Order Entry)
  * drug interactions checker
  * other coding assistants
* Free Software
* License GPLv3

!

### ![FreeMedForms logo](img/logoddi.png) The FreeMedForms community
* not-for-profit community
  * medical doctors
  * computer workers/scientists
  * pharmacist
* about 50 members (10 active members)
* from France, Canada, Germany, Austria, Australia, New-Zealand 
* supported by OpenSuse Medical, Debian Med, Fedora Medical, Arch Linux
* collaboration with free software EMR projects: GNUmed, FreeMed, Care2X, SynapseEMR
* totally independent

!

### ![FreeMedForms logo](img/logoddi.png) The FreeMedForms project

* __GNU/Linux, FreeBSD, MacOs X, Win32, Win64__
* C++ using Digia's __Qt__ libs
* documented using Doxygen
* massive usage of MVC architecture and __unit-tests__
* Built using dynamic libraries with __plugins architecture__
* database: SQLite and/or MySQL/MariaDb

!

### ![FreeMedForms logo](img/logoddi.png) Classifications to understand drug interactions

Some useful and sometimes problematic classifications  

* Drugs
 * ATC Anatomical Therapeutical Chemical classification
 * INN International Non-Proprietary Name

* Diseases
 * ICD10 : International Classification of Diseases version 10

!

### ![FreeMedForms logo](img/logoddi.png) What is a drug interaction?

A drug can interact with  

* another drug: __drug-drug interaction__ (__DDI__) 
* patient's conditions: __patient-drug interaction__
 * acute or chronic disease
 * allergy, intolerance
 * renal filtration
 * age
* food & alcohol: __food-drug interactions__ (__FDI__)
* labtest-drug interactions: drug efficiency monitored by lab tests
* Potentially Inappropriate Medications __PIM__ specific interactions regarding elderly

!

### ![FreeMedForms logo](img/logoddi.png) Drug interactions

__Drug interactions create severe even fatal adverse events__

* __Always growing__
 * Number of marketed drugs
 * Number of known drugs interactions
 * Number of prescribed drugs
 * Preventive treatment
* __Elderly are at increased risk__
 * many diseases means many therapies
 * many diseases means altered physiology

!

### ![FreeMedForms logo](img/logoddi.png) Drug Interactions alert system

![slide 7 drug interactions alert system](img/slide7-drug-interactions-alert-system.png)

!

### ![FreeMedForms logo](img/logoddi.png) Timing of the alert system

![slide 8 timing of the alert system](img/slide8-timing-of-the-alert-system.png)

!

### ![FreeMedForms logo](img/logoddi.png) Free DDI Manager

* __Motivation__
 * Allow users to __create__ their own drug interaction set
 * Allow users to __share__ their own drug interaction set
 * Facilitate the contribution process

* __Current status__
 * Beta version, some features still missing, but mainly usable
 * All FreeMedForms drug databases are created by Free DDI Manager

!

### ![FreeMedForms logo](img/logoddi.png) Free DDI Manager workflow: drug database

This part allows users to prepare any drug database

* Get drug database raw source
 * France
 * USA
 * Canada
 * South-africa
 * Belgium
* Transform raw source into computable source
* Extract all drug components

!

### ![FreeMedForms logo](img/logoddi.png) Free DDI Manager workflow: prepare drug recognization

* Edit ATC classification (not required)
* Edit interactors
 * Interactors database is independant of the drug database
 * 1 interactor can be 1 ATC code, drug component, class/group of ATC/interactors/classes
* Edit all drug components
 * Link with an interactor or ATC code (partially by hand)
 * Check, review, comments: done by hand
* data can be shared between users

!

### ![FreeMedForms logo](img/logoddi.png) Free DDI Manager workflow: create a DDI

* Drug-drug interactions are currently limited to 2 interactors interactions
* DDI are defined using a risk model, a preventive/management message and bibliographic references from PubMed
* DDI must be checked and reviewed by hand
* FreeMedForms community wants to create a free and open source DDI database usable in any country
* We created an «Interactions Committee»
* Legal and medico-legal issues are not yet clearly defined and solved.



!

### ![FreeMedForms logo](img/logoddi.png) Interactions Committee

* Shah et al. 2006 [2]: "high user acceptance of ambulatory computerized prescribing alerts when using a selective knowledge base and minimizing workflow interruptions"
* commercial knowledge bases
 * highly inclusive
 * emphasis on breadth of coverage, not on clinical relevance or severity of adverse events
 * conflicts of interests: often directly or indirectly owned by pharmaceutical industry
* FMF Interactions Committee
 * Free & open source
 * 100% independent
 * review interactions
 * classify: relevance to setting, severity
 * Evidence Based Interactions: references (PubMed), levels of evidence, Summary of Product Characteristics
 * lobby academic, governmental, institutional interactions committees:  
   -> publish under free licenses!  
   -> use & contribute to Free DDI Manager!

!

### ![FreeMedForms logo](img/logoddi.png) Free DDI Manager workflow: manage datapacks

* Create a datapack and a "datapack server"
* Upload Packs
* Share server configuration
* Users only have to configure your server and select Packs to install

!

### ![FreeMedForms logo](img/logoddi.png) Alert philosophy[1]

* Two kinds of alerts:
 * __Non-blocking__ → icon and tooltip
 * __Blocking__ → blocking dialog, require user action
* Alert system provides three levels: low, medium, high
* And an infinite number of __categories__ (DDI, PIM, drug
duplication, dose checking, allergies, intolerances...)
* __Threshold__ of alerts can be adapted by the user for each
type of alerts
* Alerts can be __dynamic__ (using scripting)
* We do our best to avoid alert fatigue

!


### ![FreeMedForms logo](img/logoddi.png) Alert philosophy

* __related to__
 * One or all users
 * Application (update notification, backup reminder)
 * One patient
 * All patients (eg: for medical prevention, cancer screening)
* « __one shot alerts__ » or « __cycling alerts__ »
* defined validity period
* edited by user or not
* __validated__ / __overriden__ & __commented__ by user
* scripted

!

### ![FreeMedForms logo](img/logoddi.png) Alert packs

* Alerts can be shared via __alert packs__
* Alert packs are shared via the __datapack manager__
* Alert packs must contain
 * packdescription.xml (datapack description file)
 * All XML alerts
* When the user install an alert pack
 * All alerts are saved
 * All alerts are checked
 * All alerts are executed (if required)
* This is really useful to share medical prevention alerts

!

### ![FreeMedForms logo](img/logoddi.png) Future developments

* Include scripting in interaction processing
 * See roadmap of the VKA plugin (labtest-drug interaction)
* Include pregnancy data
 * [Australian governmental data](http://www.tga.gov.au/hp/medicines-pregnancy.htm)   
   http://www.tga.gov.au/hp/medicines-pregnancy.htm
* Include dose / renal failure
 * [dosing.de](http://dosing.de)  
   https://dosing.de
* Finish PIMs implementation

### ![FreeMedForms logo](img/logoddi.png)Thank you!

* Thank you for your attention
* Eric says "Kisses to my wife and children (who support my devs...)"
* Jerome says: "Thank you Eric for coding so fast & well, thanks to the FMF community for your contributions and for sticking with us despite our bad english! :)"

Now I will present a short video of the FreeDDIManager.

[FreeDDIManager video presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgmfcmyCrSU "Free DDI Manager video") https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgmfcmyCrSU

You will see how easy it is to build and share your own set of interactions.
